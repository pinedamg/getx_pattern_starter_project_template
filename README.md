# Flutter GetX Pattern Starter Project Template

The name says all, the idea is speeding up the development process, to be focused only on the most important features of your new project, and keep moving forward on your new adventure.

## Why I created this repo?

At the moment of start it, I was not able to found a repo with these characteristics or behaviors.

So I've decided to create it with the most common use cases of an application.

## Current flow
